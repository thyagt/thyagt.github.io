My name is Thyag <i>(t-y-ah-g)</i> Raj. 
<p>I am based in Hazaribagh, India; currenly in Delhi.</p>
<p>My undergraduate major is Production and Industrial Engineering at IIT Delhi. The courses are very similar to Mechanical Engineering, but relies more on opitmisation strategy and practical applications. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

My interest lies mainly in Machine Learning, preferably in Computer Vision, and NLP. (That is what I have tried so far, and <i>I am more inclined to NLP.</i>)

<p>I suck at Maths at times, or bust my head on concepts but I still love doing it because they are worth challenging. </p>

<p> I am partially deaf (110dB Right Ear; 60 dB Left Ear), 
      <ul>
  <li>I prefer to lock myself in the room, wear earphones, and watch something on 90% of the system's volume</li>
  <li>60% in case it is a Windows machine, else 100% on my mobile phone</li>
  <li>Else avoid human 70% of the times</li>
</ul>
 </p>
